    <q>Anyone who believes in indefinite growth of anything physical on a physically finite planet is either a madman or an economist.</q>
    <p>– Kenneth Boulding, economist</p>

    <p>Vast disparities exist in consumption and impact between the rich world and the Global South, and within countries themselves. A more just global system, in which resources are distributed more equitably, is essential. Whatever form that takes, in order to ensure that there is enough to meet everyone's right to a decent standard of living, the richest must consume more sustainably - in other words, consume less. When nations leave poverty, their fertility rates rates reduce - but hand-in-hand with that increasing prosperity comes increased consumption. People should not have to compete for the Earth's resoures.</p>
    <p>
    That's why population and family size is an issue in both developed and developing countries. Where affluence and consumption is high, reducing the number of new consumers is an effective, permanent way of reducing the drain they place on resources, as well as their environmental impact. It does not mean that people should not do other things to reduce their consumption, or that wider isues of global injustice do not need to be urgently addressed. Nevertheless, reducing, through effective, ethical means, the number of affluent people consuming is an essential, effective method to relieve the pressure.
    More than 800 million people currently do not get enough food to meet their nutritional needs every day. Meanwhile, 650 million are obese. People go hungry not because there is insufficient food but because our global economic system distributes it unfairly.</p>
    <p>  
    However, every extra mouth to feed puts more pressure on our food supply. That is already under threat from multiple factors, including shortage of fresh water, soil depletion, decimated populations of insect pollinators and climate change. The UN currently projects that we will need 70% more food by 2050. Increasing agricultural production comes at a cost to nature, however. Habitat loss and exploitation are the two most significant threats to biodiversity - currently 80% of extinction threats to mammals and birds are due to agriculture.</p>

    <h2>Solutions to overconsumption</h2>

    <p>     
    It's obvious we need to stop ravaging the planet.
    Unfortunately, our 'I am what I buy' culture is an obstacle. It leads to farcical advertising slogans like "Be yourself" – as if wearing mass-produced fragrance can give you a true sense of who you really are.
    There are more meaningful ways of defining identity, like belonging to something you love – a sports club, community choir, animal rescue sanctuary etc. We need public authorities to create more of these social opportunities to give people a sense of purpose beyond being a consumer.</p>
    <p>
    Marketing can help. It's a powerful tool for changing behaviour. Once used to encourage smoking, it's now doing completely the opposite. If it can change our relationship with tobacco, it can change how we consume too. This means promoting activities and stuff that are good for people and planet.
    And we need stronger laws. Companies should be made to report on every single aspect of their supply chains – from excavation right through to the shop window – including water and land use, and climate-changing emissions.</p>
    <p>
    We need circular economies that prioritise re-using, recycling and repairing. Societies designing stuff to last longer – using our precious and limited natural resources far more cleverly.
