    <q>No water, no life. No blue, no green.</q>

    <p>The seas provide half of our oxygen, and food for a billion people. Let’s give them the protection they deserve.
    Under the restless surface of our seas, hundreds of miles from land, there’s a world of giants and hunters; ancient lifeforms and lost cities.      
    These waters beyond national borders are home to creatures even more varied than in the tropical rainforests. They contain the highest and longest mountain range anywhere on our planet, and trenches deep enough to hold Mount Everest. They’re the highways for whales, turtles, albatross and tuna on their cross-planet migrations.      
    Protecting these natural wonders is simply the right thing to do. But this isn’t just about conscience. It’s about survival.      
    The oceans produce half of our oxygen and food for a billion people. And because they soak up huge amounts of carbon dioxide, they’re also one of our best defences against climate change. Our fate is bound to the fate of our oceans. If they don’t make it, we don’t either.</p>
    <p>HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARE threatening the health of the world's oceans. More than 80 percent of marine pollution comes from land-based activities. From coral bleaching to sea level rise, entire marine ecosystems are rapidly changing.
    Global warming is causing alterations in ocean chemistry and many oceanic processes, and it is threatening many species of marine animals that cannot cope with higher temperatures. Overfishing is a serious problem in many parts of the world. Conservationists advocate creating expansive marine reserves to protect the biodiversity of the oceans.
    </p>
    <p>Those threats are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal population centers.</li>
      <li>Many pesticides and nutrients used in agriculture end up in the coastal waters, resulting in oxygen depletion that kills marine plants and shellfish.</li>
      <li>Factories and industrial plants discharge sewage and other runoff into the oceans.</li>
      <li>Oil spills pollute the oceans, though U.S. water-sewage treatment plants discharge twice as much oil each year as tanker spills.</li>
      <li>Air pollution is responsible for almost one-third of the toxic contaminants and nutrients that enter coastal areas and oceans.</li>
      <li>Invasive species such as poisonous algae, cholera, and countless plants and animals have entered harbor waters and disrupted the ecological balance.</li>
      <li>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 31.4 percent of fish stocks are either fished to capacity or overfished.
      </li>
