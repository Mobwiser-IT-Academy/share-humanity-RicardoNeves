    <p>Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They help people thrive and survive by, for example, purifying water and air and providing people with jobs; some 13.2 million people across the world have a job in the forest sector and another 41 million have a job that is related to the sector. Many animals also rely on forests. Eighty percent of the world's land-based species, such as elephants and rhinos, live in forests. Forests also play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns.</p>
    <p>
    Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling combined account for more than half of all deforestation. Forestry practices, wildfires and, in small part, urbanization account for the rest. In Malaysia and Indonesia, forests are cut down to make way for producing palm oil, which can be found in everything from shampoo to saltines. In the Amazon, cattle ranching and farms—particularly soy plantations—are key culprits.
    Logging operations, which provide the world’s wood and paper products, also fell countless trees each year. Loggers, some of them acting illegally, also build roads to access more and more remote forests—which leads to further deforestation. Forests are also cut as a result of growing urban sprawl as land is developed for homes.      
    Not all deforestation is intentional. Some is caused by a combination of human and natural factors like wildfires and overgrazing, which may prevent the growth of young trees.</p>

    <h2>You can contribute to the efforts against deforestation by doing these easy steps:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>-Plant a Tree where you can.</li>
      <li>-Go paperless at home and in the office. </li>
      <li>-Buy recycled products and then recycle them again.</li>
      <li>-Buy certified wood products.</li>
      <li>-Support the products of companies that are committed to reducing deforestation. It’s all about business. If you don’t buy, they will be encouraged to  improve their practices.</li>
      <li>-Raise awareness in your circle and in your community.</li>
      <li>-Buy only what you will use. </li>
      <li>-Don’t use Palm Oil or products with Palm Oil.</li>
    </ul>
