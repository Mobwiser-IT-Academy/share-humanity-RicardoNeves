      <p>Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.</p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <a href="deforestation.html">Deforestation</a>
      <p>Human-driven and natural loss of trees—deforestation—affects wildlife, ecosystems, weather patterns, and even the climate.</p>      
    </div>

    <div class="box-3">
      <a href="protect&the&Oceans.html">Protect the Oceans</a>      
      <p>Earth’s vast oceans, long viewed as an infinite supply of food and a bottomless repository for our waste, have been pushed to the brink. Now, with sea levels rising and coral reefs dying, our oceans’ ability to support marine life — and us — is at risk. It is time to sound the alarm.</p>
